  Every fixture came out of fastavro, and so did every expectation:
  `ground-truth.edn` is emitted by the same script from the files it just
  wrote. That matters more for Avro than for the columnar formats, because
  **Avro writes no type tags** — a decoder that is wrong about the schema
  produces plausible values rather than an error, so a self-generated fixture
  would agree with a wrong decoder."
