(ns avro.binary
  "Avro's binary encoding — the value grammar, with nothing about files in it.

  Its own namespace for the reason `parquet.thrift` is: this is a
  self-contained byte grammar, and keeping it apart is what lets it be tested
  against sequences taken from the specification rather than against this
  repo's idea of an Avro file.

  ## Everything variable-length is a zigzag varint

  Ints, longs, string lengths, byte lengths, array block counts, union
  branches. One reader, used everywhere, which is why getting its sign
  handling right matters more here than the small amount of code suggests: a
  varint read as unsigned turns every negative int into a large positive one
  and every union branch index into nonsense, and both still decode to
  *something*.

  ## Ints and longs share an encoding but not a range

  Avro writes both as zigzag varints and distinguishes them only in the
  schema. So a decoder cannot tell from the bytes whether a value was meant to
  fit in 32 bits, and this namespace does not try — `long` is what both
  produce. On ClojureScript a magnitude past 2^53 is refused rather than
  rounded, the same rule the Parquet and Arrow readers apply.

  ## Opting into exact 64-bit values on ClojureScript

  Refusing is the right default: a rounded 64-bit identifier is worse than
  no identifier, because it still looks like one. But a file can carry a
  full-width long in a field the reader does not care about — an Iceberg
  manifest names its data files in a string and its snapshot in a 64-bit
  id — and refusing the record loses the string along with the id.

  Binding `*long-mode*` to `:bigint` decodes exactly those values as a
  **BigInt**, which is exact. Values that fit stay plain numbers, so no
  caller has to handle two types for small values:

      (binding [avro.binary/*long-mode* :bigint]
        (avro.file/records manifest-bytes))

  The default is unchanged, and this is additive: nothing that decoded
  before decodes differently now."
